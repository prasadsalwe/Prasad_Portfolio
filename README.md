Analytics Porfolio

Hi, I am prasad salwe.I am an [Engineer (Electronics) + Management (Operations)] professional with an analytics background. I have developed a strong foundation in data and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as a data specialist.

During my job, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data analysis, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

I also enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems by recommending practical solutions.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
